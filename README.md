# Pong-Game
This is a pong game created with turtle in python
There are two players, referred to as Player Left and Player Right, each controlling a paddle to hit the ball. The ball bounces randomly upon hitting the top, bottom, or the paddles. If the ball crosses the left or right edge of the screen, the opposing player scores a point. Once a player reaches a certain number of points (currently set to 10), the game declares a winner. The winner's name at the top of the screen turns green, while the loser's name turns red. A dialog box also appears to announce the winner.
